Docstring for arrays.In-Place Merge of Two Sorted Arrays

This problem appears in interviews at FAANG, Adobe, Microsoft, etc.

You are given, for example:

nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, _, _, _]   # size = m + n (extra space at end)
nums2 = [2, 4, 6]               # size = n

Goal:
Merge nums2 into nums1 so that nums1 becomes:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
